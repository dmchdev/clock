NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE PYGAME MODULE INSTALLED. 
Please visit pygame website to download and install appropriate module.

Clock was created with Python 3.4. The Pygame version was installed from the .whl file, reference to which is available on Pygame download page. This file is hosted elsewhere and it's a 32-bit version. That is ok as long as the python version matches with what's indicated in the .whl's name.
